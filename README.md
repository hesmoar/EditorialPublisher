## Roadmap
1. [ ] Single shot render files should follow the naming convention stablished for the project version entity.
   * [x] Done in standalone version
   * [ ] Add to modular version

2. [x] Connect process of edl export and rendering
   * Done in the standalone version

3. [ ] Add button or script to resolve to start the process from inside

4. [ ] Load versions from Kitsu into Resolve timeline
   * [ ] Latest versions for each shot
   * [ ] Based on a Playlist
   * [ ] Ask user for specifc tasks
   * [ ] Flag user if any shot has changed from the latest editorial cut 

5. [ ] File management. 
   * [ ] Check for existing files and names based on a specific directory structure
   * [ ] Creation of folders and files 
   * [ ] Syncronization setup using syncthing or other file management systems 
   * File Management could maybe work with Prism. 
   * [ ] File management should also be as modular as possible so it can be software agnostic. 

6. [ ] Add support to transitions, effects and other elements done in multiple tracks by editorial.

7. [ ] Add support to run process in a render farm to avoid using the user computer

8. [ ] Implement other editorial software
   * [ ] OpenShot
   * [ ] Kdenlive
   * [ ] Adobe Premiere
   * [ ] Avid

9. [ ] Investigate what would be the input for editorial from storyboard or animatic. Exports from storyboarder or toon boom storyboard.
