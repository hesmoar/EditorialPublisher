## **Requirements**

1. Python 3.7 - 3.10
2. DaVinci Resolve
3. OTIO
4. Kitsu Server


## ‚öôÔ∏è **Installation**
This setup is assuming you have a kitsu server already set up or not planning to use Kitsu functionality 
Kitsu setup guide: https://zou.cg-wire.com/#

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hesmoar/EditorialPublisher.git
cd EditorialPublisher
```

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**

- Add the following variables:

```
PIPE_SCRIPTS_PATH= Path where you store the repository
KITSU_URL= URL to your kitsu site
KITSU_EMAIL= Your email to access Kitsu
KITSU_PASSWORD= Your Kitsu password 
```
- Make sure Da Vinci Resolve scripting environment is properly setup you can refer to this documentaion: https://resolvedevdoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/API_intro.html

3. **Install Required Dependencies**

- If you‚Äôre using a virtual environment:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. **Move main.py into the path where your Da Vinci Resolve stores the scripts**
   - Usually in the following path:
   ```bash
   C:\ProgramData\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Fusion\Scripts
   ```
5. **Adjust Script values to your own project and pipeline needs**
   - There are certain values that are currently specific for my project and pipeline setup but you can modify as needed. 
      - Regex pattern for shot names found at the start of **kitsu_editorial_publisher.py**
      - Render Preset selection, this is currently set to the first preset. You can find this inside **render_utils.py** in the following functions:
         - single_shots_render_settings
         - full_cut_render_settings
      - Kitsu custom field "timeframe_in" and "timeframe_out" you can change this to whatever field you want to use inside of kitsu. You can find this in **kitsu_editorial_publisher.py**


## üí° **Usage**

1. **Prepare DaVinci Resolve**
   - Open DaVinci Resolve.
   - Load your project.
   - In the edit page lets set 2 timeline markers (these will determine the start and end frame of your full cut):
      - Blue marker: on the start of your cut
      - Red marker: on the end of your cut 
   - In the Deliver page set your mark in and mark out


2. **Run the Script**
   - In DaVinci Resolve got to the Workspace menu
   - Select Console, this will bring up the console, make sure to select Py3
   - Go to the Workspace menu again
   - Select Scripts
   - Depending on where you saved the script it will appear on the menu 
   - Click on the script and it will begin to run

3. **Select Output Folders**

- A GUI will appear, prompting you to:
   - Directory Selection:
      - Select the **Render Output Folder**. (This is where you want to save your renders)
      - Select the **EDL/OTIO Export Folder**. (This is where you want to save your EDL file)

   - **Automated Processing**
   - The script will:
     - Export the OTIO file to the selected folder
     - Delete existing render jobs in the DaVinci project.
     - Apply rendering settings by using the selected values and preset in the GUI.
     - Ensure files have a unique name including the version suffix (v001)
     - Render the new render jobs
     - Compare the metadata from the OTIO file with the information in Kitsu and update if necessary
